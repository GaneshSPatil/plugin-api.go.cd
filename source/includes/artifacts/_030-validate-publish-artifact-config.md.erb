## Validate Publish Artifact Config

This call is expected to validate the user inputs that form a part of the publish external artifact config.

<p class='request-name-heading'>Request name</p>

`cd.go.artifact.publish.validate`

<p class='request-body-heading'>Request body</p>

The request body will contain a JSON object with the keys and values that form part of the profile.

> An example validation request body for the docker elastic agent plugin

```json
{
  "Image": "gocd/gocd-demo",
  "Tag": "boohoo",
  "BuildFile": "foo.json"
}
```

<p class='response-code-heading'>Response code</p>

The plugin is expected to return status `200` if it can understand the request.

<p class='response-body-heading'>Response Body</p>

> The plugin should respond with JSON array response for each configuration key that has a validation error

```json
[
  {
   "key": "Image",
   "message": "Either `BuildFile` or `Image` must be specified"
  },
  {
   "key": "BuildFile",
   "message": "Either `BuildFile` or `Image` must be specified"
  }
]
```

If any of the input keys have a validation error on them, the plugin is expected to return a list of [validation error objects](#the-validation-error-object). If the profile is valid, the plugin should return an empty JSON array.

<aside class='notice'>
  There are some cases wherein the GoCD server cannot make the request to validate the plugin configuration when configured from the UI. This usually happens when the plugin id cannot be determined from the publish or fetch config.
  The request to validate the plugin properties happens only from the UI and the API. It does not happen when the cruise-config.xml is directly edited.
  Given the above cases, is recommended to perform the plugin validation right before the publish or fetch operation as well.
